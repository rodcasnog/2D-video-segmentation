# 2D mitral valve segmentation in echocardiography video data

A collection of experimental notebooks were I develop a 2D video segmentation model based on U-NET to identify the mitral valve from a pumping heart using echocardiography video data. It is trained on a mix of datasets of different durations and resolutions.
